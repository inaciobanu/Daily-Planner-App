# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Task

Create a simple calendar application that helps a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.

## Applying What we've learned this week

Thsi week's activities in preparation for this challenge involved:
- jQuery - creating, updating, appending HTML elements
- Attaching functionality to events + use of the .css() method
- DOM Traversal using jQuery
- Event delegation; turning Browser API Elements into jQuery elements
- Rewriting JavaScript as jQuery (a comparison)
- jQuery UI widgets, including Dialog, Autocomplete, and Date Picker
- jQuery interactions (sortable)
- Using Moment.js to calculate time differences.


## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```
 
## Acceptance Criteria

The app should:

* Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
 
* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
 
* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
 
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

* Persist events between refreshes of a page

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
